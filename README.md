Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) is a non-profit organization committed to increasing awareness, education, and resources to support mental well-being within the technology and open source sectors. Initiated in 2013 by Ed Finkler during his presentations at tech conferences, OSMI emerged in response to the substantial feedback to Finkler's discussions about his own experiences with mental health issues as a web developer and open source enthusiast.

Annually, OSMI conducts surveys to understand the preferences of employees within the tech industry worldwide regarding mental health treatment. The 2014 survey specifically gathered insights from individuals in tech companies who experience mental health disorders, whether diagnosed, undiagnosed, or even just suspected, to identify any factors that may influence their decision to seek treatment.

The findings from these surveys offer valuable insights for HR departments, utilizing machine learning to identify key factors that companies need to address to encourage employees to pursue mental health treatment.

Mental health influences our emotional, psychological, and social wellness, shaping our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It plays a crucial role in our ability to manage stress, interact with others, and make decisions. In the context of the workplace, effective communication and inclusivity are essential for the success of high-performing teams or individuals. The repercussions of mental health on an organization can lead to a rise in absenteeism and a decline in both productivity and engagement.
